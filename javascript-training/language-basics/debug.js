// Debugging the program step-by-step

// 1. Add the break points (before the line where you want to manually execute the program).
// 2. Run the program in debug mode.


// Continue (F5)       => Continue the auto execution till the next breakpoint.
// Stop (Shift+F5)     => Stop the execution completely.
// Restart (Ctrl+Shift+F5) => Restarting the execution of the program from the beginning.

// Step Over (F10)     => Execute the current line and move to the next line.
// Step Into (F11)     => Go inside the function and check the internal code.
// Step Out (Shift+F11)=> Come out of the function and move to the next line.



// Logic to get the sum of two numbers
